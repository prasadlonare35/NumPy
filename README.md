# NumPy Learning Scripts 🧮

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate basic to intermediate concepts of **NumPy**, one of the most popular Python libraries for numerical computing.

## 📖 About NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It provides high-performance, multi-dimensional arrays and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them.

## ✨ Key Features:
- Supports vectorized operations for fast and efficient computations without using explicit loops.
- Provides advanced mathematical operations such as linear algebra, statistics, Fourier transforms, and more.
- Supports creation and manipulation of 1D, 2D, and n-dimensional (nD) arrays.
- Optimized for working with large datasets where standard Python lists would be slow and inefficient.
- Enables element-wise operations on arrays (e.g., add, subtract, multiply arrays directly without loops).

## 📚 What's inside?

### 1️⃣ `CreatingArraysWithNumPy.py`
- Creating 1D & 2D arrays
- Array properties (shape, dtype, ndim, size)
- Special arrays (zeros, ones, identity matrix, etc.)
- Indexing & slicing techniques on arrays and matrices

### 2️⃣ `ModifyingWithNumPy.py`
- Mathematical operations on arrays (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- Broadcasting with scalars
- Aggregate functions (sum, mean, median, std, etc.)
- Generating random numbers
- Reshaping and flattening arrays

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## 🚀 How to run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasadlonare35/NumPy.git
   cd NumPy
2. Run any of the Python files:
    ```bash
    python CreatingArraysWithNumPy.py
    python ModifyingWithNumPy.py
## 🎯 Purpose
These scripts are part of my learning journey to master NumPy basics and core operations.

Feel free to use or extend them for your own learning! 🚀
